**Description:**
Sportly is a redesign of the classic sports website that utilizes a visuals based interface and modern web techniques to provide the user with an experience that brings the content to the forefront (utilizing large images, colors, and clear text). 

**HOMEPAGE**
The top menu bar is designed to give the user as much information as possible, as fast as possible. The logo in the top left always returns the user home, the headline ticker provides the user with the most up to date information. When one hovers, the ticker stops and one can follow the link (if they were live). Most recent scores are also provided, with an option to view more which takes the user to the scores page. Directly below this initial menu is a submenu that provides the user with instaneous access to any of the sports. Football is currently live. Next there is a large cover photo that highlights the big story of the week. This links directly to an article page on the superbowl. Right below is a spot to highlight another major breaking news headline that should stand on its own from the rest of the content. Below is a grid of most recent headlines that is laid out with imagery to provide as much content for the user without having to follow a link. Moreover, the icons in the top right corner of each box tell the user what the sport that is being shown is. There are also tags along the bottom of the blocks to give the user quick information about what each block refers to. Hovering provides the headline and clicking (if it were live) would take you to the article. Ads are also integrated as separate blocks, they have borders and captions that indicate that they are ads.

**More Scores**
Linked to by the “view more” link in the menu bar. Provides the user with more information and more scores then just in the menu bar. Hovering over the scores animates a quick summary of the games and clicking would direct you to the article.

**Article Page**
Accessed by clicking on the superbowl cover photo. Provides the user with a cleanly laid out article that does not distract from the content. Ads are also integrated in a similar manner.

**Player Page**
Accessed by clicking on Ray Lewis on the superbowl page. Provides the user with a page similar to a profile page. Most recent articles as well as stats are provided without any distractions. Stats can be expanded by hovering

**Sport Page**
Accessed by clicking “Football” from the menu bar. The menu bar compresses to provide more room for content yet the links are still available to each sport. An additional row is added to provide navigation within the sport. Football articles are laid out in a manner that is consistent with the home page. Tags are provided at the bottom of the images to provide quick context. Hovering provides the headline. Clicking would take you to the article. On the right is a menu that provides the user with the most recent/live scores as well as the most recent headlines. If the user compresses their window size down, the sidebar will hide, but can always be accessed by a menu button that pops out in its place. The grid will also rearrange to fit multiple window sizes.
