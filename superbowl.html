                    <span>NEW ORLEANS -</span> It's too early to say whether Super Bowl XLVII is the greatest big game of them all. It's not too early to say that this was the craziest. There were more jaw dropping, "what the heck just happened?" moments in this game than any we can remember. If this Super Bowl was the final act of a movie, we'd criticize it for being too unbelievable. But it all happened Sunday night in the Superdome.

Super Bowl MVP Joe Flacco threw three first-half touchdown passes, Jacoby Jones ran back the second-half kickoff a record 108 yards for a score, and star linebacker <a href="player.html">Ray Lewis</a> ' last play fittingly was part of a defensive effort that saved the victory.
                        </br></br>
                        As parts of the stadium went to black in the opening moments of the second half, the worst nightmare for the Baltimore contingent was that the Ravens could lose momentum at the exact point they were on the cusp of delivering a knockout blow in the Super Bowl, and taking away the ending this back-from-the-brink season deserved.
                        </br></br>
                        But Joe Flacco knew, even when a three-plus touchdown lead had evaporated and he was in agony on the sideline watching his defense be picked apart in the final minutes. “I think it’s fitting we won that way,” the MVP of Super Bowl XLVII said.

                    The rout, a win by blowout, would not have felt as right. They needed the theater, someone to tell them they couldn’t right before they did. Said Reed, smiling big,
